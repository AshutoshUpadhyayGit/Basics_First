Strings:

To learn from: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp

-> Replace func: string.replace('word','by')
-> Index Slicing: 
Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])........5 is not included so till index 4

Negative Index Slicing:
Get the characters from position 5 to position 1, starting the count from the end of the string:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2]).......-2 not included so till -3.

-> Strip function:
The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:

a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"

-> Check if the phrase "ain" is present in the following text:

txt = "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain"
x = "ain" in txt
print(x)

O/P: True

-> String Formatfunction:

The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:

Example
Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:

age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))


The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:

Example
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

You can use index numbers {0} to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:

Example
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))



-> Reversing a string:
a) By slicing: string[len(str):0:-1 ] which is equivalent to string[ : :-1] meaning start with len(str) till 0 at step of -1.


b) Use join
This is a powerful technique that takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s iterator protocol. This technique reverses a string using 
reverse iteration with the reversed() built-in function to cycle through the elements in the string in reverse order and
 then use .join() method to merge all of the characters (with "something") resulting from the reversed iteration into a new string.

The general syntax is:
str="Python" 

eg 1 : b = "Python"
print("/".join(b))  -----O/P: P/y/t/h/o/n

eg2: 

reversedstring="".join(reversed(str))

O/p: nohtyP

reversedstring="/".join(reversed(str))

O/P: n/o/h/t/y/P
